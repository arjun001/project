Extending Project:

1. Time Lapse and Video Recording via Manual, Auto or 
	Scheduled Time/Timer control Motion Detection.
 
2. Making webcam follow movement/object of interest (PySerial Package).

serial_port = serial.Serial(1) #Opens COM2
serial_port.write('I') #Initializing 
x = serial_port.read()
    
# Estimating depth and depth uncertainty at each pixel and incrementally 
refining these estimates over time. Kalman Filter a good choice. 
Kalman filtering as a viable framework for this problem, because it incorporates 
representations of uncertainty and provides a mechanism for incrementally reducing 
uncertainty over time
  
# Finding Movement to Right or Left
# Resetting Camera Angle


3. Reserve Memory Disk Space

4. Implement a field range of interest

5. Applying this code to various environments to get better idea of threshold
     which is related to sensitivity of detecting motion
